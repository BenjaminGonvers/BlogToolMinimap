title: Tool Minimap
---

The reason of the tools
The tools is needed because of a not friendly usage of the creation of the minimap.
before the tools we have nothing, for create a minimap, we need to manually screen shot the upward of the map for have a minimap view.
this is not very useful, because the image need to be resize and have a view no orthographic , that’s mean its not a flat map.
the tool, have for objective to have a easy button that take the minimap, and have the format needed in this final form.
with that it’s more simple to make the minimap
the old workflow is
go to the upward of the map-> take a screenshot->open in a editor->crops all unneeded content-> resize the map-> rework the map with artist -> drag the map in the right place -> recenter the map with the scene -> use it.
the new workflow:
open the tools->click “create minimap”-> Rework the map with artist -> drag the new map into the tools-> use it.-
The advantage of the new workflows is that more simple, and it’s fast to see the minimap in the editor.
